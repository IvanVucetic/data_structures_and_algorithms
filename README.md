###Project 1: Searching Binary Trees   
   
   *You'll build a simple binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input and also the "crawler" function that will locate data inside of it.*   

###Project 2: Knight's Travails   
   
   *A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns. Your task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.*
